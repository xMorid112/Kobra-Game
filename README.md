# Kobra-Game

KOBRA is a mini version of the classic Snake game built for the chipKIT board with a Basic I/O Shield. Written in pure C by me <3. 

ðŸŽ® How to play
- The snake slithers smoothly across the 8x8 LED matrix

- You steer it with the shieldâ€™s buttons (up/down/left/right)

- Eat the dots, grow longer, and whatever you do, dont be dumb and crash into  yourself


ðŸ§° What you need
- A chipKIT board (e.g., Uno32)

- A Basic I/O Shield

- MPLAB X and the XC32 compiler

- Curiosity, excitement, and maybe some nostalgia... unless you were born after 2006 ðŸ˜„


A classic snake game, but on hardware because Morid Faraj doesnâ€™t just play games, he builds them. or does he ? ðŸ˜Ž
